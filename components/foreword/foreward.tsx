        There was a time when the cavemen of Altamira painted those rudimentary
        symbols on the cave wall to keep count of wild animals 36000 years ago
        and now we are found sending automated robots to a planet 360 million
        kilometres away from our home. What we can conclude from this is that
        Mathematics has always been an indispensable factor towards the
        advancement of mankind. Furthermore, now it is an established fact that
        the progress and achievements of a nation depend largely upon the
        scientific and mathematical temperament of its populace.
        <br />
        <br />
        Keeping these in mind, Douglas Memorial Higher Secondary School will be
        hosting a two day virtual festival of Mathematics called &apos;Douglas
        Mathletes Meet 2021-2022&apos;, the sole purpose of which is to break
        the monotonous rut that we are all in since the beginning of the
        pandemic and to bring forth the children together where they can create,
        innovate and explore Mathematics like the way never imagined before.
        <br />
        <br />
        The events of the festival were designed in such a manner that not only
        will it bring out the creativity of the children but also the
        mathematical rigour of them will be on display. This world class affair
        is bound to create ripples of excitement through the community and it is
        our hope that it will heighten the consciousness about the
        indispensability of the apparently dreaded Mathematical sciences.
